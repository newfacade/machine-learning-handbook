    "1. Reduce the optimal bundling problem to the graph coloring problem by taking features as vertices and adding edges for every two features if they are not mutually exclusive.\n",

    "2. Use a greedy algorithm which can produce reasonably good results.\n",
    "\n",
    "To construct the buddle, we can add offsets to the original values of the features to make sure the bundle is invertible. For example, suppose we have two features, feature A takes value from $\\left[0, 10\\right)$ and feature B takes value $\\left[0, 20\\right)$. We then add an offset of 10 to the values of feature B so that the refined feature takes values from $\\left[0, 30\\right)$.\n",
