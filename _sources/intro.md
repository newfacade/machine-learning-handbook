# Introduction

```{note}
Machine Learning is a field devoted to understanding and building methods that `learn`, that is, methods that leverage data to improve performance on some set of tasks. It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence. <br>
关于机器学习的定义，Tom M. Mitchell 的这段话被广泛引用："A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performace measure P if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E".
